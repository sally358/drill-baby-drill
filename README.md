# drill-baby-drill
repo for the poker drill player i am working on.
I have my personally crappy drill replayer which requires you to launch http server and has a comically bad data storage system, so i decided that since i made DP:FE with export drill function public, I'll
make a vue-tauri remake of that drill replayer too, with better interface, more feature and other stuff. It will support the drill exports from DP:FE (the dpfe part of the equasion will also be modified for
more stuff).

Stuff I'm planning to transfer from my personal drill player:
* Preflop drill player (does not support subsequent postflop scenarios, these two are completely separate entities).
* Postflop drill player.
* Preflop drill creator (the only way you can get preflop drills currently, as we don't have a preflop solver here) including a scenario player and a range editor.

There is no postflop drill creator, as postflop drills are far too complex to be created manually. You still can import DP:FE drills though just fine.


# Gem Gemson announcement
###Prepare for the Ultimate Excavation!
Hello, everyone! It’s me, Gem Gemson, everyone's favorite PRO here at the eternally innovating, multi-quadrillion dollar data deity, DP:FE Inc. Gather 'round, put on your hard hats, and prepare your seismic sensors, because the ground is about to shake with a brand new application from the mind of our peerless CEO, Sally358!

Get ready to experience the raw, unbridled power of "Drill, baby, drill!"—the app!

Introducing: "Drill, baby, drill!" (The Application)
That’s right! The phrase we shouted when we launched the first export drills is now an entirely new application, and it is everything the name suggests: a dedicated, relentless tool for deep, analytical excavation.

This app is the ultimate sequel to our existing functionality, transforming data peeking into full-scale digital mining. You will now be able to drill some pres and even some posts—penetrating layers of information you previously only dreamed of accessing. If your data has a past or a future, you can now drill right into it!

Total Integration and Enhanced Drilling
The best part? "Drill, baby, drill!" will be fully integrated with the "export drills" feature you already know and love in the main DP:FE application.

We’re not just releasing a new tool; we’re fundamentally reworking and updating the entire DP:FE drilling experience! The existing feature will be massively upgraded, allowing you to:

Drill More Info: Access deeper sub-layers of data than ever before.

Peek into the Drilling Tables: Get a literal look under the hood at the raw data structures driving your analysis.

View Global Percentages: Contextualize your local drill with broad, high-level metrics.

Your data is about to give up all its secrets, and this app is the master key!

The Auditory Delight of Failure
And finally, for a touch of classic DP:FE flair, Sally358 has built in a feature that is both hilarious and mildly embarrassing: Failure Feedback!

If, and only if, you fail to execute a drill correctly (perhaps a typo in a parameter or a truly tragic miscalculation), the "Drill, baby, drill!" app will be able to toggle funny vocoded meme sounds! Yes, your mistakes will now be greeted with the digital jeer of a robotic voice, ensuring you learn your lesson and get a giggle.

Get ready to dig! "Drill, baby, drill!" is coming soon to a server near you!
